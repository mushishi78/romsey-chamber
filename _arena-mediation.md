Welcome to Arena Mediation - Mediation at its best

Arena Mediation offers a confidential mediation service to divorcing and separating parties. We facilitate options and solutions for our clients to make their own decisions about financial settlements and child arrangements.

All our mediators are accredited with the Family Mediation Council [FMC] and can undertake statutory MIAMâ€™s and Mediations.

If you are eligible for legal aid, we can offer free mediation. Arena Mediation also offers a free MIAM and first mediation meeting to a fee paying client if the other party is funded.
