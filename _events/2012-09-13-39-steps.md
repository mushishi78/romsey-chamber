# The 39 Steps

ByJohn Buchan, adapted by Patrick Barlow ![39Steps](images/events/39Steps.jpg)

Thurs 13 Sept - Sat 15 Sept 2012

Fresh from a week's run at the Minack Theatre in Cornwall (see [www.minack.com)](http://www.minack.com/), this play is an hilarious adaptation of the Hitchock film of the John Buchan Novel.

The dashing Richard Hannay has been framed for murder. Can he track down the real murderers and solve the mystery of the 39 steps before the police catch him? Set in the 1930s, our hero deals with femmes fatales, assassins, spies, mad professors and a host of colourful characters. Multiple parts are played by three of the actors (at least 30 between them). The action is fast and furious with an accent on physical comedy - with chases on the Flying Scotsman steam train and under the Forth Bridge. Also featured are a bi-plane crash, car chases and a death defying finale at the London Palladium!
