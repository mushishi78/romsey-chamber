Dear members,  
  
Following the launch of our informal networking event 'Final Friday'in September, I am delighted to say that following a very enjoyable and well attended event we will be holding the next Final Friday at The Whitehorse Hotel Romsey on Friday 26th October from 5.30pm to 6.30pm  
  
This will be the same format as before, please come along and bring two business cards with you and of course anyone who you would like to introduce to your fellow members. One business card will be drawn to win a bottle and one will be drawn and the 'winning' business given the opportunity to speak about their business for two minutes.  
  
Do please come and join us.  
  
See you there!  
  
John Natt  
Treasurer
