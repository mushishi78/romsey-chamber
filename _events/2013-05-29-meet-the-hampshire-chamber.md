Potential members will be able to gain an insight into how to prosper and grow with the Chamber organization whilst networking in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. For a small cost we are able to offer existing members on a first come basis no more than two of the same sector exhibition space, giving them an opportunity to profile their products and services. We are also able to offer a number of new members a brief elevator pitch beat the clock in 15 seconds!
