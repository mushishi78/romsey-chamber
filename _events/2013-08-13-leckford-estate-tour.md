The Leckford Estate is a sustainable farm owned by the John Lewis Partnership.

The tour takes around 1 hour 45 minutes with a starting point yet to be confirmed and will conclude with refreshment (hopefully) at the new farm shop! Those attending will need to make their own way to the confirmed meeting point on the estate but a map will be provided nearer to the time.

The cost of the event to Chamber members and their guest will be £10 per head, the charge for non chamber members will be £15 per head.

As there are a limited number of spaces available, these will be allocated on a first come first served basis (please note that your place is **NOT** secure until payment is received). Payment can be made via cheque made payable to Romsey and District Chamber of Commerce, 18 Market Place, Romsey, Hampshire, SO51 8NA. if you would prefer to make an online payment, please contact the Chamber office on telephone or email for details.
