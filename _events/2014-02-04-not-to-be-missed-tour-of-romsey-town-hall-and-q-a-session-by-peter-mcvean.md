Not-to-be-Missed Tour of Romsey Town Hall and Q& A session by Peter McVean

Venue: Romsey Town Hall, 6pm, Tuesday 11th February 2014

The evening starts with a welcome from the Mayor, Councillor Ian Richards, along with refreshments; this is a good time to meet other members and guests.

Following this Peter McVean of Footner Ewing will open the floor for Questions and Answers on Property law. This will be one of the few chances to get advice from a solicitor without getting a big bill.

There will then be a tour of the Town Hall by Romsey's resident guide and historian, Barbara Burbridge.

We do hope you can make it.

Please let us know ASAP by emailing [info@romseychamber.co.uk](mailto:info@romseychamber.co.uk)

Best wishes

Romsey and District Chamber of Commerce & Industry
