The White Horse Hotel and Brasserie and Romsey Abbey are set to stage their first joint wedding exhibition, creating 'Your Romsey Wedding'

The emphasis is very much on local services and suppliers and aims to promote a Romsey Wedding. We have many suppliers exhibiting their goods including wedding dresses, chauffeurs, stationers, cake makers, florists - the list goes on.

Romsey Abbey will welcome visitors for a cat walk display of wedding dresses, Abbey choir and bell-ringing demonstrations and photographs showing previous weddings held there. Romsey Choral Society will also be performing, with a demonstration of their repertoire. Revd Tim Sledge and his clergy team will be on hand to offer advice and to take wedding bookings - with a 2014, 15 and 16 diary already on the go!

Revd Tim Sledge said 'Whilst many couples prefer not to get married in a church, there are many who do, and there are also many who don't think they can, but can. We want to say yes to them and Romsey Abbey offers a stunning venue for the wedding of many couples' dreams or a smaller, more intimate service in one of its side chapels. We want to present the best that Romsey can offer for a wedding from heaven.'

There will be a horse drawn carriage to transport you from the Abbey to The White Horse or vice versa where canaps and welcome drinks will be served.

The White Horse will demonstrate everything you could possibly want for your perfect wedding day, from an intimate gathering to a more lavish affair.

Sarah Bingham, Events Manager at the White Horse said 'The White Horse is the perfect location in Romsey for your wedding day. We are delighted to partner with the Abbey to create 'Your Romsey Wedding'.
