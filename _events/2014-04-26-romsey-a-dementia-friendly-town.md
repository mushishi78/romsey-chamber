Everyone knows someone with dementia. Imagine how difficult it is going shopping with a sufferer, the assistant looks at you with sympathy, but has no idea how to help you with your shopping. Well now, Romsey is now a dementia friendly town, help is on hand. Andover Mind Charity, who are behind this incentive, are offering training to local traders, following which they can displaywindow stickers,letting carers know help is on hand.
