Just a quick reminder that this month's RRBF visit is to Romsey Abbeyon Tuesday 14 October 2014 @ 6pm. Please let us know if you will be attending to give us an idea of numbers.

The details have been sent out before but are below for reference:

The visit will be split into two tours taking about 40mins each:

Part 1 will be a tour downstairs led by the Rev Canon Tim Sledge  
Part 2 will consist of a tour of the upstairs by the Verger, Chris Harpham.  
There will be a short refreshment break.

We are asking for a nominal fee of 2.50 for members and 4.00 for non-members which can be paid on the night.

Please RSVP to [info@romseychamber.co.uk](mailto:info@romseychamber.co.uk)by the 10th October.

This is a wonderful opportunity to see parts of this building which are normally off limits, and I hope to see as many of you there as can make it.
