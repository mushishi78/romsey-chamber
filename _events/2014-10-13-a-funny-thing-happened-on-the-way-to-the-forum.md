Set in ancient Rome, this bawdy laugh-a-minute comedy follows the cheeky but lovable slave Pseudolus who will do anything to gain his freedom.

The original Broadway production garnered five Tony Awards and finally closed after almost 1000 performances exactly 50 years ago. RAODS expects that its forthcoming production will also be popular, and it has a wonderful cast of talented actors and singers who having been rehearsing since June to make it a success.

"Everyone's had a lot of fun on this production", says director Matthew Ellison. "In many ways, the show is much more like a farce than a traditional musical. It has all the ingredients: larger-than life characters, mistaken identities, bawdy humour and it is played at break-neck speed." The West End production in the 1960s starred Frankie Howerd as Pseudolus and led to him continuing and developing the character in the popular TV series 'Up Pompeii!'
