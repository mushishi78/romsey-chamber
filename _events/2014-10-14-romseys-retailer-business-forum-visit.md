Just a quick reminder that this month's RRBF. Please let us know if you will be attending to give us an idea of numbers.

The details have been sent out before but are below for reference:

The visit will be split into two tours taking about 40mins each:

Part 1 will be a tour downstairs led by the Rev Canon Tim Sledge.

Part 2 will consist of a tour of the upstairs by the Verger, Chris Harpham.
There will be a short refreshment break.

We are asking for a nominal fee of £2.50 for members and £4.00 for non-members which can be paid on the night.

Please RSVP by the 10th October.

This is a wonderful opportunity to see parts of this building which are normally off limits, and I hope to see as many of you there as can make it.
