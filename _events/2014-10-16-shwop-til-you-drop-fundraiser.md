Need to overhaul your wardrobe but out of funds and worried about Christmas? Rums Egs Shwopping event could be just the ticket. Back by popular demand, the evening provides an opportunity to turn all your unwanted clothes and accessories into points that you use to select stylish new outfits for free (extra points for designer items and premium labels). Nothing to shwop? Then buy points for only 1 each.

Tickets are Â£7.50, which includes a glass of wine and nibbles. Bar and great raffle. All funds raised will support development of the Rums Eg education programme.
