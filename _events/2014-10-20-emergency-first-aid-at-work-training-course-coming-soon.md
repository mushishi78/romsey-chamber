Dear All,

The Chamber is offering both members and non-members of the opportunity to attend an Emergency First Aid at Work training course. If you or someone else in your company wish to attend please email us as soon as possible.

The event will take place at the Abbey Park Industrial Estate and will cost 75 if you are a member or 100 for non-members. This price includes a sandwich lunch. If you are interested, please let us know how many places you would like to book as there are a limited number of places available and we wouldn't want you to miss out.

Below are the dates we have provisionally booked the venue and trainer and we will pick the date when most can attend. Please can you let us know which date(s) suits you best.

Tuesday 4th November  
Thursday 6th November  
Tuesday 11th November

If there is sufficient interest, there is the possibility that more than one course can be arranged to ensure that all those wishing to take the course can participate.

Kind regards

Holly Wigmore
