**Just a quick reminder that next Tuesday there will be a Fire Safety Workshop**.If you havent already done so, please let us know if you will be attending to give us an idea of numbers.

The details have been sent out before but are below for reference.

The training course will help managers and business owners complete their Fire Risk assessments and learn about fire risks, etc.

The Workplace Fire Safety for Managers workshop will also assist business owners and managers in understanding their responsibilities.

The workshop will include:

Fire Officer Sharon Cross will be available at the end of the session to speak to and to book visits to your businesses.

There will be a nominal charge of £3.50 per member, non-members are welcome at a cost of £5.00 per person. This cost is just to cover the refreshments that will be on offer.

Please RSVP if you would like a place.

I hope to see many of you here. Please be aware there are many companies trying to get you to pay to complete risk assessments etc. Please don't, come along to this first and then speak to the Fire Officer.

Kind regards
