The Romsey Community Lantern Project will be holding it's annual Public Meeting on 26th February from 7:30pm at Carars Together, Love Lane, Romsey.

For the past 3 years Romsey has enjoyed the Lantern Parade on Late Night Shopping Evening, with over 300 colourful and imaginative lanterns, all made by local community groups, contributing to the town's Christmas celebrations. The organising committee is changing and new people are now needed, to cover the amount of work involved in setting up and running lantern-making workshops in the 2-3 months prior to the Parade, finding funds to cover the costs of materials, labour and venue hire as well as managing the logistics of Parade Day itself.

If you are interested in helping to decide the future of the project please come along to the meeting (RSVP [mavis.sawdy@gmail.com](mailto:mavis.sawdy@gmail.com)). A poster is attached for further information.
