Hampshire County Council Press Release 24th February 2016
 
News just in, we have received the following press release from Mark Edgerley, Romsey Town Centre Manager, which gives details of a public exhibition to be held next Monday 29th February from 2pm to 7pm in the Crosfield Hall – a public consultation is open to Friday 8th April
 
Have your say on almost £2 million of further proposed improvements to Romsey Town Centre 

Residents, businesses and the wider community are being encouraged to have their say on the proposed second and third phases of improvements for Romsey town centre.

The new proposals, in which Hampshire County Council is planning to invest around £1.75 million of capital funds, will look at enhancing Bell Street, from the junction with Middlebridge Street to just south of the Market Place, by 2017, with Market Place as the proposed third phase to follow in 2018.

Councillor Seán Woodward, Hampshire County Council's Executive Member for Economy, Transport and Environment, said: "Improving the environment and supporting the economic viability of the historic town centre is a key aim of these proposals, while increasing accessibility for all. Bell Street currently suffers from narrow pavements, speeding traffic and localised congestion when there are deliveries, all of which can discourage people from visiting the area. Our proposals look to address these problems."
"We are looking for feedback from the public, and I would encourage people to get involved."

Hampshire County Council and Test Valley Borough Council have been working together to improve Romsey town centre to make it more accessible to pedestrians and cyclists, reduce traffic speeds and make the area more attractive generally, for all who live, work and shop there. County Council Leader, and Member for Romsey Extra, Councillor Roy Perry underlined the importance of the partnership, adding: "Hampshire County Council is committed to working closely with Test Valley Borough Council to help keep Romsey the attractive and successful town it is."

Councillor Martin Hatley, Portfolio Holder for Planning Policy and Transport at Test Valley Borough Council and Chairman of the Romsey Future group, said: "I welcome the proposed schemes to provide better access for all users, including pedestrians, cyclists, parents with pushchairs and wheelchair users. It will also reduce traffic speeds and enhance the appearance of this historic part of the town centre. The proposed enhancements to Bell Street and the Market Place will seek to encourage both residents and visitors to spend more time enjoying the town, visiting its attractions and browsing its many shops thus adding to its economic prosperity. I would encourage all to have their say on the proposals."

The first phase of the County Council-funded town centre improvement works in Church Street cost £570,000 and included the raising of the carriageway to the same level as existing footways, the widening of pavements to improve accessibility and the narrowing of the road to encourage lower vehicle speeds. Street furniture was also replaced adding to the overall quality of place within the town centre.
In addition three tactile paved crossing points were added, two along Church Street and one across Church Place, to help blind and partially sighted people access local shops and amenities more conveniently.

A public exhibition on the proposals for the second and third phases of work will be held on Monday 29 February in Crosfield Hall, Romsey from 2-7pm. The consultation is open until Friday 8 April 2016. Plans can be downloaded from Test Valley Borough Council's website and people can also submit their views online.

Finalised plans for Bell Street will be considered by Councillor Woodward, as Hampshire County Council's Executive Member for Economy, Transport and Environment, in the summer.
