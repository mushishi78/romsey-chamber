The Relay Marathon is a unique opportunity to raise money for charities of your choice by running as part of a team to complete a marathon.

Teams are comprised of 10 runners who each complete two laps of a 1.3 mile circuit before handing the baton over to their team mate. 

The Entrance Fee is £120 per team, with a £20 reduction for those teams registering before the end of February.

Feel free to enter, if there are not enough in your business to make a team the Chamber is running two teams that you can join at £10 per person. Email info@romseychamber.co.uk for more information.
