Music, dance and street entertainment will return to Romsey on Saturday 9th July, when the 24th Beggars Fair takes place. Expect to see and hear over 80 acts across 20 venues and all for free at Romsey’s Summer Music Festival.

Throughout the streets and in venues all around the town, the best of local musicians bring you an eclectic mix of folk, jazz, blues, soul, rock, bluegrass, classical and world music. Together with colourful dance displays and children’s entertainment there is plently of entertainment on offer.

The Beggars Fair has been running since 1993 and is living up to its aims of showcasing local talent in a friendly environment. From big bands on the Cornmarket main stage to intimate acoustic music in tranquil gardens, cheerful pub sessions and spellbinding storytelling.

The day has a great atmosphere that keeps bringing people, and performers, back year after year.

One of the orginal goals of the first committee in 1993 was “to create a new tradition for Romsey, involving musicians, dancers, entertainers and above all audience” This it certainly now is. A truly unique communuity event and the busiest Saturday in Romsey all year.
