We will be holding the next Final Friday on Friday 31st March from 5.30pm to 6.30pm, venue yet to be confirmed

This will be the same format as before, please come along and bring two business cards with you and of course anyone who you would like to introduce to your fellow members. One business card will be drawn to win a bottle and one will be drawn and the 'winning' business given the opportunity to speak about their business for two minutes.

Do please come and join us.

See you there!

Peter Speirs
President
