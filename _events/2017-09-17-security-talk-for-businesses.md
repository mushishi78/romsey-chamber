## Security Talk for Businesses, 17th September 

Romsey Chamber of Commerce and Romsey Town Hall are pleased to be jointly hosting a Security Talk for Businesses.

This will be taking place in the Town Hall, Romsey at 6.00pm until 8:30pm, Wednesday 13th September 2017.

We will be bringing together a panel of advisors who will offer a brief snippet of their services and advise/talks on certain issues arriving around security in your business and how to obtain overall protection.

Also attending will be the Cybercrime unit from Hampshire Police, Croma security specialists, Local Police, and a Commercial Insurer.

After the talks and any questions we can lead into a networking session as it is an ideal opportunity to mingle.
