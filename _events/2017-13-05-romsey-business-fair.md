## Romsey Business Fair, Saturday 13th May 2017
### Sat 9:30 · Crosfield Hall, Romsey · Romsey

A fantastic opportunity to showcase your business to the public.

Open to any business in Romsey & District supplying goods and services to the public. All businesses are welcome; we especially want to invite businesses that do not currently have a prominent position in Romsey Town Centre.

We offer a FREE trade stand, 2 x 2 metre square, we can supply a 1.8m table plus chairs if required.
Stands to be staffed when exhibition open to public, no stand to be removed before 1.30pm.
All participants are requested to promote the event to their customers on websites and social media. We suggest that you offer an “event promotion” perhaps a discount voucher for orders placed within a limited time period after 13th May.

Event will be free to enter for the public

There are many successful businesses in the area that trade from industrial estates and other hidden locations in Romsey. This is your opportunity to meet potential new customers without the high costs usually associated with Business Fairs. 

We do not wish to take trade away from local cafes so we are not planning to offer refreshments in the hall unless a local café offers service using onsite facilities.

To book a stand please contact Mark Edgerley, Town Centre Manager by 30th April
