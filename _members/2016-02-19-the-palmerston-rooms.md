The Palmerston Rooms

In the heart of Romsey, The Palmerston Rooms is a recently renovated and upgraded Bed and Breakfast in a beautiful grade 2 listed building.

Formerly known as The Wessex Guest House, the building has been used as a B&B for at least 50 years. The building dates back to the early 18th Century, formerly being two separate houses, It is within an easy 5 minute walk from the train station and just 2 minutes from the bus station.

You will be guaranteed a warm welcome from Graham and Kay who have both lived in Romsey all their lives.

Graham has been in the hospitality trade all his working life and his claim to fame is that he has cooked for the Queen and Prince Phillip on a number of occassions whilst working in Stockbridge.

Kay started her working career as a beautician and has continued to do this whilst also working in the hospitality trade. The Palmerston Rooms will offer beauty treatments to our guests and the general public.

Graham and Kay met 10 years ago and have been married for 2 years. They have now decided to put their combined years of experience into this new venture.
