for At Ocean World Travel, we’re proud to be one of the UK’s leading cruise Specialists. We specialise in ocean cruises, river cruises and luxury cruises. For more than 20 years, we’ve been helping our fantastic customers find the perfect cruising holiday – and of those customers who responded to our questionnaire 100% are so happy they would rebook with Ocean World Travel
We don’t just expect to offer the best price possible, we’re committed to providing the best service too.
We believe that customer service is of paramount importance, and that’s why we always go above and beyond for each customer, from service to pricing. As a leading cruise specialist, we have a certain level of influence with each operator, allowing us to pull a few strings that other agents aren’t able to.

Ocean World Travel: our history
Founded on the living room floor of a semi-detached house in Birmingham, way back in 1995, we’ve come a long way since. We grew rapidly, and moved down to Winchester in 2003, in order to keep expanding. And we did just that. By 2005, we decided that we need to be on the front line, and took up our office in the ‘cruise capital of Europe’, Southampton. Recently we moved to the nearby pretty village of Romsey.

A lot has changed for us, but our values remain the same: we’ll offer the best price, and the best service.
We want to do more than send you on holiday, we want to help you set sail on the cruising experience of a lifetime. We’ll guide you through the entire process, from finding the ship that’s right for you, to booking your excursions. It’s your voyage, we’re just here to make things a little easier. You’re never more than a telephone call, or the click of a button, away from a member of our friendly staff.

Ocean World Travel was originally founded by Michele and then she was joined by her life companion Alan. It was clear since the beginning that cruising would have shaped their lives: Alan and Michele met whilst onboard a cruising holiday. They got engaged on the launch of Vision of the Seas, and even got married onboard the Queen’s favourite ship, Hebridean Princess.

Michele–Director
Travel has always been one of my biggest passions. I've spent more than 30 years selling cuises, and have been an avid cruiser since I was 19. I worked for Thomas Cook for 8 years, where I was lucky enough to travel the world! I've been fortunate enough to climb Ayers Rock, hike and camp over 120 miles through Iceland, fish in Zambia, hiked the Grand Canyon - I even watched the Berlin Wall come down.
I spotted a gap in the market - none of the big travel brands were focusing on cruise. So I started Ocean World Travel to do just that.

Alan - Director
I joined Michele back in 2000. I'd previously held a senior role at Cadbury's. Having always been a chocolate connoisseur it seemed like it would be my dream position - as they kept me inundated with an unlimited supply of the sweet brown stuff! But, if I'm honest, my heart's always been on the water.
Both of our lives have involved cruising so much, it only seems natural that we should run a business dedicated to just that.

Charlotte Nelson - Sales manager

With over 12 years of Management experience in Travel It will always be a passion of mine. I love talking to customers and love sharing their experiences and learning new things every day. I have been lucky enough to Travel to some of the most wonderful places including hiking the Borneo rainforest, Helping Children in Africa and touring America. The Cruise industry is massive, exciting and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. We have a great team and some very dedicated passengers. We are very lucky.

Robert – Manager
Having spent the last 3 years working for Carnival UK as a Personal Cruise Specialist for P&O Cruises and Cunard, I jumped at the chance to join Ocean World Travel. With their unrivalled customer service and expert 'multi-brand' knowledge. I knew instantly, this was a company I wanted to be part of. It's a true pleasure to work with such elite Cruise Specialist on a daily basis.
