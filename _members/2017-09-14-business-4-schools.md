## Business 4 Schools

Does your business value its place at the heart of the community?  Are you struggling to get your business's voice heard above the chatter?

Then let Business 4 Schools help you.

Business 4 Schools provides a unique bridge between your brand and the schools in your area.

We're in the business of communication, successfully producing termly newsletters and other school and college marketing material which can be supported with advertising from local businesses.

We worked with a two-pronged approach, with the Business 4 Schools website linked to the schools' websites, giving advertisers an even wider audience.

Captive audience

Businesses have quickly seen the value of advertising within these products, reaching out to a huge audience of parents and school stakeholders.  Theirs is a captive audience, straddling a wide demographic, who want to read what is happening in their local school.

So let us open the door for your business to sit at the heart of the community and to partner with your school.  There are plenty of inexpensive opportunities to support the school and further promote your business.
