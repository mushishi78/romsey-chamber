## The Veterans Bereavement Support Service

The Veterans Bereavement Support Service was created by those who have served in the Armed Forces and Merchant Navy  and also for those who serve or have served in the Cadet Forces and to ensure that they have full access to a specialist bereavement support network at the time of need for their family and friends. Since its inception, the service has grown and through the massive network of professionals we are able to offer a comprehensive range of services that support people not just after they have lost someone special but also before, so that the support is available and that they can plan ahead.help.
