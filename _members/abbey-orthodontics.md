Abbey Orthodontics was set up in 1998 by Liz Weeks in the market town of Romsey in Hampshire. Liz's vision was to create a practice centred on clinical excellence within a welcoming and caring environment.

As our orthodontist at the practice, Liz, ensures continuity of care, along with her committed experienced team. All the staff are highly qualified in the roles they perform and are committed to providing the best treatment, encouraging and supporting patients throughout their time with us.
