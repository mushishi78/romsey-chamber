We fully support our local suppliers where possible and believe in using sustainable produce, in particular our fish. If there is a dish that you would like to see on our menu our chefs are always open to suggestions!

We cater for Christenings and birthday parties, in fact any occasion that requires a private room!

If you are planning a party or celebration of any sort we are always delighted to quote and tailor a menu to your specific requirements. We are seeing many more wedding parties these days as customers opt for smaller, intimate groups in their favourite restaurant rather than the larger venues which are less personal.
