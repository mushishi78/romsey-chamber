## Dedicated to creating and managing your wealth

We are a specialist team, dedicated to creating and managing your wealth. We are fully independent and managed by the owners on a day-to-day basis, meaning that most client contact is with the directors who have collectively nearly 50 years experience in the financial services sector.

In addition to being totally independent, we are recognised as chartered financial planners, meaning that calculis has the ability to provide the very best advice in the short, medium and long term.

At calculis, we have several unique planning tools and protocols which differentiate us. We provide individuals, companies and professional introducers with a range of services focused on exceeding expectations in the early years and providing lasting value in the years ahead.

Many clients have entrusted members of the senior team to manage and develop their finances, over many years. To find out why, call to arrange a free initial meeting to discuss your plans or concerns: 01794 525500

We look forward to hearing from you - if you prefer, just e-mail [here]("http:/www.calculis.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47&Itemid=50" ""here"")and we will get back to you within 24 working hours.
