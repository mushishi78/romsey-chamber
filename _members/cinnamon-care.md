## Specialist residential and dementia care – including permanent care, respite and day care services 

Abbotswood Court, our newly purpose-built Care Home that has been carefully designed with its residents as its priority opened to its first residents in September 2015.

Set on the edge of the historic market town of Romsey, within the new Abbotswood development of new homes and nestling within a conservation area, Abbotswood Court sits within its own grounds and landscaped garden. Each floor within the Home has been designed to be spacious, light and airy with its own identity. 

The quality of the design, build and finish is second to none and allows us, Hartford Care, to deliver our unique concept of care to every resident.  Abbotswood Court is designed to provide a warm and comfortable welcome along with meeting the continuing individual needs of older people.  Abbotswood Court is able to provide specialist residential and dementia care – including permanent care, respite and day care services – delivered by a team of caring, qualified and experienced staff.

The 60 individual bedrooms, with en-suite wet rooms, are light, spacious and comfortable and many rooms will benefit from lots of natural light due to the large windows.  There are also bedrooms and communal areas on the ground floor with patio doors directly leading out to the secure gardens.   

Abbotswood Court has been carefully created with three underlying values at its core. These are care, comfort and companionship.
