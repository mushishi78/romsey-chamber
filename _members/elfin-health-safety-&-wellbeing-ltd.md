Professional Health & Safety Advice and Training
Health and safety is essential for any business in keeping up-to-date with the latest legislation and protecting the well-being of employees, customers and visitors.

At Elfin (Health, Safety & Wellbeing) Ltd, we understand how difficult it can be to look after health and safety policies, procedures and training in the workplace. This is especially true for small or medium sized businesses where having a dedicated health and safety officer simply isn’t practical.

That’s where we come in. As experts in all aspects of workplace health & safety advice and training, we are here to help you comply with all current legislation through professional advice and training. We can help you ensure that all health and safety policies, procedures, risk assessments and inspections are fully up-to-date, whilst also making sure that your employees receive suitable and sufficient training.
