Fella's is one of the finest independent barber shops in Romsey that has been established since 1955.

For almost 60 years we have been providing traditional haircuts and modern re-styling to men of all ages.

Over the years we have built up a fantastic reputation and have won many awards for our contemporary approach to men's hairstyling. We can offer you your traditional style and remain consistent in our approach to quality, as well as providing you with a complete re-style that keeps you looking sharp and looking good.
