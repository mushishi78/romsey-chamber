We want to be the best provider of services in the market and that means we service to all the current standards, we do not carry out half a job and charge the customer for a full job. We have taken over so many sites where companies are clearly leaving a customer open to prosecution or reduced cover on their security. I take this personally and want my team to get it right for the customer and offer a professional service. We put our customers at the centre of our business. We do care about each and every customer and I am more than happy to take feedback, visit customers and deal with complaints personally, we work hard to find customers and we dont want to lose one.
