I started Fire Care & Security Ltd when I realised there were gaps in the Fire & Security market for companies to offer a competitive honest approach to regulatory requirements.

We want to be the best provider of services in the market and that means we service to all the current standards, we do not carry out half a job and charge the customer for a full job. We have taken over so many sites where companies are clearly leaving a customer open to prosecution or reduced cover on their security. I take this personally and want my team to get it right for the customer and offer a professional service. We put our customers at the centre of our business. We do care about each and every customer and I am more than happy to take feedback, visit customers and deal with complaints personally, we work hard to find customers and we dont want to lose one.
