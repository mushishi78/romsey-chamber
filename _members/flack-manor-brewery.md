Flack Manor Brewery is an independent brewery based in Romsey, Hampshire. Set up in December 2009, Flack Manor aims to bring quality cask brewing back to Romsey using the traditional method of Double Dropping. We are supplying cask ale and bottled beer through pub and club outlets in the surrounding areas of Romsey as well as through our brewery shop.
