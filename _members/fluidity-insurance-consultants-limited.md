## Fluidity Insuance Consultants Limited

Fluidity Insurance has been owned and run by Liz Neilson Cert CII since 2014. She has over 25 years of extensive experience in working in commercial insurance underwriting and the broking industries.

Delivering excellent customer service through building key client relationships forms the core focus of the business. We aim to exceed expectations and always provide our clients with suitable products at competitive premiums.

The Brenda Locke Award for Women in Business was awarded to Liz in 2016, as part of the Test Valley Business Awards. This was won through showing an ongoing commitment to customer service, the ability to support other local women in business as well as charity and community involvement on a business and personal level.

Liz is also involved on a management level with other business support groups as well as being a charity volunteer for various local organisations.
