Jo specialises in children and family portraits. Capturing the magic of childhood is at the heart of my photo sessions. 

Jo can create photos that show their spirit, curiosity of life, and the connections between your family. I work on location, using natural light. Her style is vibrant and whimsical. 

A relaxed approach is adopted by Jo and she prides herself on being super patient with children (and dads!). 

Based in Hampshire and happy to travel, Jo is also available for private and commercial projects and able to collaborate with other businesses.
