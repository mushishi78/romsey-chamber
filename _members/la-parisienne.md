## Bonjour et bienvenu a La Parisienne

Established in Romsey for 18 years, La Parisienne offers diners the chance to relax in the ambiance of an authentic French restaurant without crossing the Channel!

Offering quality & value for money, La Parisienne has become a part of the Romsey community, boasting a successful lunch trade as well as evening dining.

Whether you are eating out for a special occasion or a 'spur of the moment' meal, you can find the right menu for you, amongst the smells of freshly baked baguettes or waft of a passing bowl of steaming mussels.
