## Luc Fine Foods 

After 24 years in the restaurant business in Romsey I have finally decided to set up an "Epicerie Fine" as we say in French or A "Deli" as you say in English.  At “Luc’s” we will be offering a wide selection of mainly French, Italian, and Locally sourced high quality Food Products.  Fantastic Wines, Speciality Cheeses, and Superb Charcuterie (Cured Meats) sliced to your requirements.  We will be pleased to prepare Special Selection Platters for your Events or Business Lunches and Tantalising Gift Baskets with a mouth-watering selection of continental food products assembled to your order.   I hope to see you soon in the shop – á bientôt, Luc.
