From a small family business established in the Romsey area, working with his father and brother, the family grew the company to a multi-million pound global consultancy, which was recently sold and acquired by an international technical service organisation.

As experienced consultants and business leaders, the family continues to advise and provide consultancy services to renewable energy projects and companies across the globe. Industry specialisms include onshore & offshore wind, wave & tidal energy, solar and general construction.

Working with clients from the earliest evaluation and analysis stages through planning and execution, to operational and retrospective work such as repowering projects. The client base is across a range of investors, developers, utilities, contractors, technology manufacturers and blue-chip organisations.
