Over the past 3 years PCC has gone from strength to strength mainly due to the loyalty of its customers. As a result, we are moving to larger premises on the same estate and we will also become a certified MOT testing station.

Drivers are continually complaining about the cost of car servicing and repair and many also feeling less than happy with the quality and level of service from dealers. It was for these reasons that PCC was set up. PCC is committed to delivering a high quality service with labour costs as much as 50% lower than dealer rates.

If you are looking for high quality diagnostics, service and advice with lower servicing and repair costs, then you've found it at PCC.
