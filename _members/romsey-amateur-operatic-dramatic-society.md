Romsey Amateur Operatic and Dramatic Society (RAODS) owns and operates The Plaza Theatre. Located between Southampton, Salisbury and Winchester, in the heart of Wessex, the Plaza Theatre is perfectly situated to serve the Test Valley's entertainment and arts needs. Smaller but more intimate than the nearby Mayflower, Nuffield and Playhouse theatres, the Plaza offers Pantomime, Musicals, Operetta, Drama, Dance, Youth productions and Live Music. Visit these pages to explore the theatre, its facilities and forthcoming shows.
