AN EXCITING NEW ART INITIATIVE FOR HAMPSHIRE

We have opened a stylish, contemporary art and craft gallery in Romsey called "Rum's Eg" (from the Old English name for Romsey), featuring the work of Hampshire or Hampshire associated artists and makers. It will be a creative centre to promote and preserve the rich and varied art and craft of our region. We formed a Community Interest Company whichwas incorporated at Companies House on 17th May 2012. A CIC is a business enterprise with the profits used to support the community and charitable institutions. We will provide facilities where groups may come and benefit from the skills and experience of our artists and crafts people as well as offering an exciting new venue for people to showcase their creative skills and sell their work. We propose to run workshops for various groups within the community including disadvantaged children and adults with disabilities.
