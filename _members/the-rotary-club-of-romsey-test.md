The Rotary Club of Romsey Test

Rotary is alive and well in Romsey. For over 25 years the Rotary Club of Romsey Test has organised events, raised funds and tried to meet need in our local community and overseas. We invite you to use this website to explore what we do now and have done in the past.

Though we employ the time and talents of our members, the things we do cannot be achieved by Rotary alone. For our success we depend on the strong links that we have with charities big and small, with schools and youth organisations and with local businesses and of course with the many individuals who are happy to help us.

Of the things you will read about here we are particularly proud of our annual Walk the Test Way event. Since it started in 2003 our walkers have raised well over £500,000 for the charities that THEY have chosen to support. Part of what they raise also allows us to carry out our Club’s charitable work. It is a big event in many ways. Last year in a single day 700 walkers raised £80,000 and together walked a distance equivalent to going from Romsey to Auckland, New Zealand.

Our club has changed a great deal since it was formed, and in the 21st century must continue to evolve rapidly in response to growing needs and to the changing pattern of people’s lives.

Rotary was founded on bringing together the two strands of business and friendship. We use the skills and contacts developed through our business and home lives and hobbies and in doing so enjoy the companionship of working together for Rotary. We also benefit from being part of a worldwide Rotary network of 1.2million men and women all of whom put “Service above Self”. That global-scale effort brings relief when disaster strikes and is now very close to eliminating the scourge of polio from the earth.

In 2016 our club has grown to 60 members but we are always on the lookout for people who might like to join us in our activities and to become part of this local and worldwide team. If you think you might be interested to learn more please use the “Contact” or “Who’s Who?” tabs.
