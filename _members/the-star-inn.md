The Star Inn is a popular pub, we extend a warm welcome to both our regulars and visitors alike. We are located just a short walk from the Market Place in the historical town of Romsey and a stone's throw from the beautiful Romsey Abbey.

The Inn dates back to the 16th Century which gives the building a unique wealth of character.
