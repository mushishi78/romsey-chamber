Situated at the heart of the historic market town of Romsey, The White Horse Hotel has been a coaching Inn for over 600 years. We offer all that you would expect  from a casual drink, or maybe dinner in our restaurant or stay over with Bed and  Breakfast, whatever you requirements we will be pleased to help.

Following three years of restoration work the hotel reopened in 2008 and now offers guests 31 individually designed bedrooms and suites with 24 hour room service, an award winning brasserie and the perfect place to host private events
