Triangulate is a small Romsey-based charity which raises awareness of the impact of stress, anxiety and other mental health issues in the workplace, both for employers and individuals. We provide:

- signposting to appropriate sources of support
- speak out to promote mental wellbeing for everyone
- facilitate workshops/training for employers

Our Guide to Mentally Healthy Workplaces, endorsed by national mental health charities, is freely available to anyone, locally or nationally, either as a booklet or as a pdf.
