# The Waitrose difference

## A belief in quality

Our reputation has been built, above all, on the quality and freshness of our food. It is what our customers want, and it is what gives us our edge over other supermarkets:

We are committed to bringing you the best quality food. Should you not enjoy one of our products, tell us and well replace and refund you. It is our policy to replace or refund you for Waitrose food and household lines if:

- a product is not at fault, but genuinely bought by mistake
- you are unhappy with the product in anyway

Applies to Waitrose produced foods and household goods. Collect in branch. Excludes Ocado.

Of vital importance to us is the provenance and traceability of the food that is on our shelves. Each of our buyers is an expert in his or her own field. Their job is to seek out the best sources of the best quality food and unusual ingredients that can't be found in other supermarkets. Much of their time is spent with the farmers, growers and suppliers, building relationships based on trust and respect. Wherever possible our buyers buy British. Increasingly, they are also sourcing local produce from small growers and suppliers close to individual Waitrose stores.

## A partnership

Unlike other major supermarkets, Waitrose isn't owned by shareholders and the City. Instead, as part of the John Lewis Partnership, it's owned by everyone who works for the Partnership. (That's why Waitrose staff are called 'partners'.) And every year they share the profits that would normally go to shareholders. As you would expect this produces an extraordinary high level of committment amongst those who work in our stores.

A good proportion of our Partners have worked for Waitrose for many years - over 20 is not unusual. They're interested in what they do and they're knowledgeable about what they sell. And the friendliness and helpfulness that our customers so often remark upon isn't really surprising when you realise that the Partners you meet in your local Waitrose do, in effect, own the store.

## Price commitment

Because Waitrose has such an enviable reputation for quality, and doesn't try to grab the headlines with price-cuts the way other supermarkets do, it's easy to assume that we're expensive. This simply isn't the case.

Each week we check the price of selected everyday items we all need to buy - like bread, toothpaste, milk, etc - against those in other supermarkets, to make sure you're getting consistent good value for money. Our Price Commitment is a promise to continue bringing you quality food that is honestly priced and so represents excellent value. And on top of this, you'll find literally hundreds of our 'Outstanding Offers' on the shelves.

## Lower Prices

Were working hard to help you spend less on everyday items. In the last few months weve lowered the prices of many products, including more than 1500 branded favourites.

Weve introduced bigger, better and more frequent special offers, too. Look out for great offers and new lower prices in your local Waitrose next time youre shopping.
