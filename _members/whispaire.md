Whispaire was formed in 1997 to provide dedicated LPG heating and hot water systems to the marine and special vehicle industries. This was quickly followed with Seaward cookers, 12v and 24v Microwave ovens and Haztec gas alarms. We hold spare parts for all the products and are happy to advise on the suitability and installation of products for individual requirements
