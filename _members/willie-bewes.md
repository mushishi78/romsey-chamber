Dear Members,

I would like to introduce myself to you: my name is Willie Bewes and I have volunteered to help Romsey and District Chamber of Commerce & Industry as Business Manager.

I have been semi-retired for the last couple of years and my wife is making 'to do lists' at great speed. For the last 20 years, I have been the MD of Transworld Yachts based at Hamble (UK agents for high quality Swedish sailing yachts), organising boat shows and marketing, a background which should come in handy for the Romsey Chamber.

My job description for the Chamber is as follows:

1. Attract new members to the Chamber.
2. Keep the website up-to-date. Please check your entry - I have added logos and reorganised the home page.
3. Add news items and diary updates.
4. Persuade you all to have member-to-member offers. Did you know, for example, that the White Horse offers a discountcard to members, and Romsey Dental Centre offers reduced fees?
5. Publish a monthly e-newsletter. This will have reports from the police, Romsey Town Hall, traffic issues, a list of new member offers and plenty more.
6. I am looking at group buying deals for members; we already have offers on credit card handling fees and discounted utilities, which we will publish soon.
7. Generally to help The Chamber Executive.

I have signed up initially for twelve months but I'm sure, with your encouragement, I will be involved for years.

I look forward to meeting up with you all over the coming months.

Best Wishes
Willie Bewes
Romsey and District Chamber of Commerce & Industry
