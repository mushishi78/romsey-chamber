Wisdom Centre is a beautiful venue with excellent facilities, suitable for conferences, staff training, meetings, holistic therapies and retreat days. The Centre is an oasis of calm set amongst gardens, and is located in the heart of the small historic market town of Romsey in Hampshire.

As well as welcoming organisations, groups and individuals who wish to hire the Centres facilities, Wisdom Centre also runs its own programme of events. Wisdom Centre is a ministry of the Daughters of Wisdom (an international Congregation of Religious Women) and welcomes people from all walks of life and from all faiths and none.
