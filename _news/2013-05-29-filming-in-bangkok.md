icm Reporting is proud to announce that they have been awarded a contract to 'cover' the 65th World Newspaper Congress in Bangkok at the start of June.

Organised by WAN-IFRA, the World Association of Newspapers, is the most important event of its type in the world.

We will be providing multimedia reports for the conference and producing 'podcasts' of the talks. In other words -

We will be reporting on the reporters for the reporters!

For many it will be surprising that a small company in Hampshire can be selected to do the job that newspapers themselves do.

The secret is actually very simple - we use technology to produce multimedia stories - video, audio, text and pictures very quickly.

This provides significant improvement in flexibility, delivery and cost.

Which means that we can do more, with fewer people for less money.
