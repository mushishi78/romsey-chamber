This year's President's Reception **was due to take place** on Wednesday 17th July, 7pm at Horsebridge Station, Horsbridge, King Somborne, Nr Stockbridge, SO20 6PU.

**We have had to postpone this event until later in the year and will notify you of the new date as soon as it is confirmed.**

Tickets are 22 (please note that if you purchase 10 or more, cost will be 20 per head)

In a change to the 'norm' our president, David Willox has decided that during his term as President he will raise funds for a second defibrillator for Romsey, this will be kept at a central point in the town so it is available for all local businesses to use should the need arise. If you would like to donate a prize for the raffle, please contact the Chamber office.

We are, in this current economic climate, actively seeking sponsorship for this event. Sponsors will be advertised on the tickets, menus, donation lists and in the local press. Any amount no matter how small or large will be gratefully received and spent wisely. If you are able to help with this, please get in touch with me at the Chamber office - 01794513135 [info@romseychamber.co.uk](mailto:info@romseychamber.co.uk)
