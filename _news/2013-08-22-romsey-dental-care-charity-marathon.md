In May the staff at Romsey Dental Care were very proud to raise over 1400 for local charity theXLP Research Trust, when we ran a relay marathon at Broadlands. David Hartley (father of the 4 Hartley boys who all have this rare disease) said 'We are really grateful to the team from Romsey Dental Care who successfully completed the course and raised such an amazing amount of money. Every penny will go directly against the core objectives of the charity; to fund small innovative research studies into XLP and to provide advice and support to XLP families across the world'. A big thank you to all our patients who supported us and listened to us talking about our training (or moaning in Sams case!)
