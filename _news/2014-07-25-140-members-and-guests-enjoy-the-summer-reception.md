This year's reception was held on a warm evening at The Water Gardens in Romsey.

The excellent weather contributed to a very successful event attended by over 140 members and guests. The evening also raised valuable funds for the Chamber's designated charity, Triangulate a Romsey-based organisation which promotes changes in understanding, attitudes and behaviours towards mental illness; and positive mental health practices in the workplace. A total of 500 will be going to the charity as a result of the evening which was declared a great success by the hard working organising committee.
