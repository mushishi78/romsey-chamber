This month, as part of Romsey Retaill and Business Forum, many Chamber members enjoyed a visit, "behind the scenes" to Romsey Abbey on Tuesday 14 October 2014.

The tour 'downstairs' was led by the vicar Rev. Canon Tim Sledge, who gave a very informative and entertaining insight into may of the Abbey's treasures whilst a tour of the upstairs, including the bell tower, was led by the Verger, Chris Harpham, and Caroline of the Abbey's bellringing team.

The visitors learnt alot about the building, its fascinating history and how its story linked to the business of the town over the past millenium.
