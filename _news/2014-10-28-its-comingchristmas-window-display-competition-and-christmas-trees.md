Dear All,

Please find attached an entry form for this year's Christmas Window Display Competition.

Closing date for submission of the entry form is Friday 28 November at 3pm. It would be great to see as many businesses as possible participating to make the town look as festive as it always does!

We're also into the last few days for you to order Christmas trees for your premises. Jo Marsh at Cook, 5 Latimer Walk, has the forms for these and they are available to Chamber members at 30 for the first tree and 25 for subsequent trees, and to non-members at 35 for the first tree and 30 for subsequent.

Kind regards

Peter Speirs  
President
