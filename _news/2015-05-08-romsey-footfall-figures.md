![]({{site.baseurl}}/Romsey_Footfall_c1qzhy)You might be interested to know that the footfall figures attached, which compare weekly totals for 2015 year to date with 2014, show a small growth of around 1.5%.

When this is compared with the falling figures in many other towns this can only be good news.

Numbers are relative rather than absolute as there is only one sensor in the town, therefore many people will not have been recorded.

Daily figures are available if anyone is interested.
