## Barratt Homes Relay Marathon - Broadlands Estate 

Romsey Chamber of Commerce are looking for people to join their team to run the relay marathon in aid of our nominated charity.

The Relay Marathon gives an opportunity for anyone to partake in a Marathon, as part of a team who collectively will run the 26 miles and 385 yards. The 4th Relay Marathon will be held on Sunday 17th April 2016 and will again be hosted at the Broadlands Estate on the outskirts of Romsey.

Each team we enter will consist of 10 members who will take it in turn to run 2 laps of a 1.3mile course before passing the baton to the next team member. The oldest competitor to date has been aged over 80 and the youngest was 8 years old, so there is scope for everyone to get involved. The event caters for both able bodied runners and those with disabilities. The race begins at 10am and course marshals withdraw at 3pm, but so far every team has completed the race well within that period.

There is an entry fee of Â£10 per runner providing your entry is received early as this fee has an early bird discount included, every penny of which goes towards Rotary charities.

If you would like to join our team, please contact us with your entry details.
