## Small Business Saturday 2016 - Update

As you will know from previous notices, Romsey and District Chamber of Commerce is once again promoting Small Business Saturday on 3rd December, and we would like you to play your part in making the day a success for the Romsey and District business community.
If you are planning to offer a special promotion on Small Business Saturday, please let us know what you have in mind so that we can help to support you via social media and a leaflet campaign on the run-up to the day. If you want your special offer or promotion to feature in our publicity, please forward details to me at info@dovetailframing.co.uk by Sunday 13th November at the latest. You might want to offer a discount or a giveaway on the day. Whatever it is, please let me know.

If you don't run your business from conventional retail premises within the town, as a member you are eligible to take part in our 'Small Business Showcase' event in the Town Hall, which will be open from 10am to 4pm on Small Business Saturday. There are still a few stands available, and all you need to do is to commit to offer a special offer on the day and to staff your stand for the duration of the event. The only charge is a nominal Â£10.00 fee to cover publicity.  Last year the businesses that exhibited gained lots of useful publicity and attention for their businesses. The event was also well supported by Caroline Nokes, MP, both Test Valley and Romsey mayors, Hampshire Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Small Business.

Whatever business you run, please also register at www.smallbusinesssaturdayuk.com and advertise your business on the 'Small Business Finder'. You can also request a publicity pack or download posters for your window to show your support.
With many thanks in advance for your help
