For the second year, Romsey Chamber of Commerce is supporting Small Business Saturday on Saturday 3rd December 2016. The initiative aims to support local businesses and to encourage more customers to ‘shop local’. The Chamber sees this as a key opportunity to both attract more trade to Romsey’s small businesses and to support our membership. The Chamber would like your business to get involved, and for you to do your bit to make the day a success!

Whatever type of business you run, please register at www.smallbusinesssaturdayuk.com where you can promote your business, download marketing material and find lots of ways to boost interest in your enterprise. You can download a marketing pack, promote a special offer and also be listed on the ‘Small Business Finder’, which provides customers with a map of participating businesses and enables them to click straight to your website. You can also access the ‘Inspire Series’ of business videos and workshops on their dedicated YouTube channel.

If you run a retail or hospitality business, then please download the marketing material, print off your window poster and display it on the run-up to Small Business Saturday. Please also publicise the event via social media and include the event in your advertising. In addition, why not consider a Small Business Saturday special offer that you can then promote via the SBS website?

If your business does not benefit from the exposure that retail premises bring, then you haven’t been forgotten. This year, once again, the Chamber is hosting a ‘Small Business Showcase’ event in Romsey Town Hall on Saturday 3rd December from 10am to 4pm. This event, generously sponsored by Romsey Town Council, will allow twelve local businesses to promote their business or sell to the public from a two metre stand in the Town Hall. Thanks to the event’s sponsor, the event is free, although a small charge will be made for publicity.

If you would like to take part in the ‘Small Business Showcase’, you must:

•	Be a current paid up member of Romsey Chamber of Commerce as at 1st October.
•	Run a business other than from permanent retail or hospitality premises
•	Consent to contribute a nominal £10.00 fee for publicity via Chamber invoice
•	Agree to offer a discount or special offer on the day
•	Commit to staffing your stand for the full duration of the event

If you wish to take part, please contact me at info@dovetailframing.co.uk to express your interest. In replying, I will assume you accept the above terms. Please give as much detail as you can about your proposal for the use of your stand. Should demand exceed supply, the Executive Committee will use the content of your e-mail to make a final selection in order to arrive at the best balance for the event and avoid duplication. Closing date for applications is Monday 10th October, and successful applicants will be confirmed by Friday 30th October.

I hope to meet as many members as possible in the run-up to Small Business Saturday 2016, and thank you in advance for your assistance with this initiative.

With best wishes

Jonathan Birch
Romsey Chamber of Commerce
Small Business Saturday 2016 Coordinator.
