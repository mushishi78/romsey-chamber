Romsey Chamber of Commerce invites local businesses from Test Valley & Hampshire to our first networking dinner at the town’s newest prestige venue, the recently opened Stables at The White Horse Hotel.

Working together with Hampshire Chamber of Commerce and Andover Town Centre Partnership, we aim to bring together 100 businesses in a social environment to meet members of Romsey’s business community.

This is a great opportunity to make connections, enjoy fine food and be entertained in one of the area’s top venues.  Early booking advised as places are limited.
