Romsey Chamber of Commerce is supporting Small Business Saturday, which takes place this year on Saturday 5th December. The initiative aims to get all sorts of small businesses involved, whether you are a family business, local shop, online business or small manufacturer. Involvement is entirely free, and there are lots of ways you can get involved and promote your business. We would particularly encourage all local businesses to visit the website at www.smallbusinesssaturday.com and register their business and either download or order a marketing pack and information toolkit, which includes various suggestions for spreading the word about your business.

By registering, your business will also be listed on the Small Business Saturday 'Small Business Finder' which enables potential customers to find your business online and link directly to your website. Several Romsey businesses have already registered and we would like to see a lot more included!
